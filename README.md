# JSP Simulator 🎮🚌  
Welcome to **JSP Simulator**, a quirky and strategic game inspired by the real-life chaos of the Skopje bus system! This game was created for the **Regional Game Jam - Empowering The Next Generation of Game Developers**, hosted by Galactic Omnivore and organized by **Galactic Omnivore, USAID, and IESC**.  

## 🌌 Theme: SPACE  
The game explores the theme of "SPACE" by focusing on **fitting people into limited space** on a bus. Your goal is to efficiently manage the crowd, seat passengers strategically, and earn satisfaction points while racing against the clock.
